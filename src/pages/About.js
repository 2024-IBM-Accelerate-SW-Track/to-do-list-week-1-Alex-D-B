        <p className='brief_description'>{'I am a rising Junior studying Math, Stats and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am especially interested in compilers and all manner of systems programming. Besides courses, I am an undergraduate TA (currently for the data structures class, but I have also been involved with other courses like the algorithms course), am a lead for the SIG for math/theory under UIUC\'s chapter of ACM, and do research on applying compiler methodologies to data science. I am currently interning at Box.'}</p>
